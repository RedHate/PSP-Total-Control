The registry editor pulls data from the registry on load time, all editing is done in memory. 

to set a database entry use the start button. circle button to cancel.
when editing entries there are 3 types, int, string and raw binary (hex)
when in binary editing hold the cross button and use the directional keys to edit a byte, without cross it will move the selector
the keyboard is self explainatory. type stuff press start or circle.
int editing is up down left and right, and press start or circle. 

If you feel you dont like your database entries, format flash1 to restore a stock registry.
